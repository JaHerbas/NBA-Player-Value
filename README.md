# NBA-Player-Value
Estimating player value based on Win Share and Salary data


This analysis utilizes linear regression to determine an NBA Player's Value based upon their on-court production.

I begin with raw data from basketball-reference.com and clean the data for analysis purposes. 

From there, I begin to further understand the data through visual representation and statistical analysis. 

Lastly, I utilize linear regression models to learn what features are most relevant and build a prediction model for players' salaries based upon their statistics from on-court performances.
